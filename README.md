## Making updates to the MDN bouncing balls JS tutorial

Exercise 1: Make a button to pause and restart ball movement.

Exercise 2: Add a button to add new balls to the field with random direction of movement and random color (don't worry about collision between the balls).

Exercise 3: Add a slider to control the speed of the balls moving around.

Exercise 4 (optional): Add some kind of UI element where you can keep track of the balls available. Give this element the ability to delete balls when clicked.
